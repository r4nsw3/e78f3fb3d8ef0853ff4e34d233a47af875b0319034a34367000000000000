  |   The squid kids called Inklings are back to splat more ink and         |
  |   claim more turf in this colorful and chaotic 4-on-4 action shooter.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   For the first time, take Turf War battles on-the-go with the          |
  |   Nintendo Switch system, and use any of the console's portable play    |
  |   styles for intense local multiplayer action.                          |
  |   Even team up for new 4-player co-op fun in Salmon Run!                |
  |   Two years have passed since the original Splatoon game was            |
  |   released and two years have also passed in Inkopolis! So expect a     |
  |   fresh wave of fashion, not to mention new weapons and gear.           |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Update/Patch Notes: v4.3.1 (v1966080)                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The previously-announced 4.3.1 update for Splatoon 2 is now live.     |
  |   This is the final content distribution, featuring new weapons and     |
  |   gear abilities.                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Specifications for some of the main weapons have been changed.      |
  |     (See Developers site for all details)                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue causing Torpedos to disappear instead of exploding   |
  |     if they touched a piece of moving terrain while following a         |
  |     player. Fixed an issue in which players dealing contact damage to   |
  |     an opponent using a Booyah Bomb with their roller or brush weapon   |
  |     wouldn't be thrown backward if they failed to splat the Booyah      |
  |     Bomb user with a single attack. Fixed an issue in Clam Blitz        |
  |     where readying a clam while being tracked by an opponent's          |
  |     torpedo would cause the aiming reticle to react, even if the        |
  |     torpedo passed through the clam. Fixed an issue occurring on the    |
  |     Walleye Warehouse stage, related to taking damage from an           |
  |     opponent's Ink Storm. While standing on the crates beneath the      |
  |     lights near the center of the stage, players would previously       |
  |     take damage from an opponent's Ink Storm while standing on one      |
  |     crate but not the other, but will now take damage while standing    |
  |     on either crate. Fixed an issue occurring on the Shellendorf        |
  |     Institute stage, where certain animations did not display           |
  |     correctly when viewed through specific panes of glass               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Changes to Ranked Battle                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Weapon specifications are taken into account when splitting an      |
  |     assembled group of eight players into teams for Ranked Battle,      |
  |     but this feature has been changed in the following ways: The        |
  |     number of players with crown icons in X Rank will no longer have    |
  |     a significant impact on team breakdown. The number of players       |
  |     using weapons from different categories such as "shooter" or        |
  |     "roller" won't have a significant impact on team breakdown.         |
  |     Instead, the specifications for each specific weapon will be        |
  |     given more weight when splitting up teams                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Changes to Salmon Run                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue occurring after creating a "With Friends" room       |
  |     where taking too long before selecting "Recruit more players"       |
  |     would cause other players not to join the room. Fixed an issue      |
  |     causing players to occasionally pass through stage terrain after    |
  |     touching and getting knocked back by a Scrapper or Flyfish while    |
  |     standing near a wall. Fixed an issue causing Scrappers to           |
  |     mistakenly not take damage when hit from behind with a direct       |
  |     shot from a Cannon                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Changes to the Octo Expansion                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue causing an unintended reaction when touching an      |
  |     ink rail while getting pulled to a Grapplink after attacking the    |
  |     Grapplink                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Other Changes                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * When using the Kensa Splattershot Jr., the sticker on the           |
  |     player's ink tank was previously the same as the one when using     |
  |     the Splattershot Jr., but is now unique. Fixed an issue in          |
  |     spectator mode that caused the "Turf Inked" stat for each weapon    |
  |     to increase incorrectly                                             |
  |                                                                         |
